🧠 NeuralPlan


Transform idle moments into neural-powered breakthroughs. An AI-driven productivity accelerator that repurposes cancelled classes into hyper-personalized, adaptive learning journeys.

🎯 The Problem


Students squander precious hours on class cancellations, defaulting to endless doom-scrolling on social media instead of seizing the opportunity for targeted growth.

💡 Our Solution


NeuralPlan harnesses Google Gemini AI to craft dynamic study blueprints that:
Adapt to your neural state (from Foggy Fog 🧠 → HyperFocus 🚀)

Micro-segmented (5-15 min bursts with built-in neural resets, ditching generic "grind" directives)
Enforce neural accountability (AI-verified logs of real vs. projected output, with predictive nudges)

✨ Key Features


1. Neural Vision Parser

Snap and upload your timetable photo → Advanced AI dissects and digitizes your schedule in seconds, auto-detecting patterns like recurring cancellations.

2. State-Adaptive Neural Plans

Foggy Fog Mode: Effortless absorption (AI-curated micro-videos, mind-map summaries, spaced repetition quizzes)
HyperFocus Mode: Immersive mastery (generative problem sets, live code simulations, adaptive difficulty ramps)

3. Neural Accountability Engine

AI-analyzed logs: Compare intended vs. executed sessions with sentiment-based insights
Efficiency neural net: Visualize progress via interactive heatmaps and predictive trend forecasts
Historical neural archive: Exportable datasets for deeper self-analysis.

4. Immersive Neural UI

Holographic glassmorphism with adaptive glows
Fluid micro-animations synced to your focus rhythm
Neural dark/light mode with eye-strain AI optimization
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python web framework) for rapid, interactive neural interfaces
AI Core: Google Gemini API (plan synthesis, image-to-schedule OCR, sentiment analysis)
Data Viz: Plotly (dynamic neural charts with zoomable timelines)
Storage: CSV (prototype neural ledger), seamless migration path to vector databases like Pinecone

🚀 Quick Start


# Clone the neural repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NeuralPlan.git
cd NeuralPlan

# Bootstrap dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Inject your neural key (create .streamlit/secrets.toml)
echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY_1 = "your_key_here"' > .streamlit/secrets.toml

# Ignite the engine
streamlit run app.py

📊 Neural Workflow


Ingest Schedule → Upload timetable image (or neural-edit manually) for AI extraction
Flag Disruptions → Toggle cancellations → Trigger instant neural rescheduling
Summon AI Blueprint → Select subject, slot duration, and state → Receive a bespoke, evolving study neural net
Forge Progress → Log sessions with voice/text input → Unlock AI insights on neural efficiency and growth trajectories
