# NeuralPlan
Neural Plan is an AI-driven productivity engine that converts unexpected timetable gaps into personalized learning sprints. Using a "Neural State" selector, it synchronizes study material with a student’s real-time energy levels via the Gemini API. Stop wasting cancelled class time; turn "dead hours" into focused, mood-matched growth.
